#Dictionary Length
#To determine how many items (key-value pairs) a dictionary has, use the len() method.

Example
Print the number of items in the dictionary:

print(len(thisdict))
Adding Items
Adding an item to the dictionary is done by using a new index key and assigning a value to it:

Example
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
thisdict["color"] = "red"
print(thisdict)
